 FILE & IMAGE HANDLING

• Artifacts are stored in a `default.json` file.
• Images are stored in an `images/` folder.
• The `imagePath` is saved in the JSON. If an image is missing, the program handles it gracefully.
• On each import or artifact creation, IDs are auto-generated if missing.

- You can use this application to prepare catalog entries and export them for future reference or sharing.
- The software gracefully handles incomplete or partially filled JSON files.
- The interface is designed to be responsive and intuitive.
